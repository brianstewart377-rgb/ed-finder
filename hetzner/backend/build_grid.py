ED Finder — Spatial Grid Builder
Version: 2.4  (apply RI trigger disable to write_conn, not monitoring conn)

ROOT CAUSE OF THE 41M STALL — DEFINITIVE ANSWER
=================================================

After 3 days of debugging across multiple strategies, here is what was
actually killing every UPDATE attempt at ~41M rows:

THE REAL KILLER: Referential Integrity (RI) triggers
------------------------------------------------------
The systems table has 8 child tables with FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES systems(id64):
  • bodies, stations, attractions, factions_presence
  • ratings, cluster_summary, watchlist, system_notes

PostgreSQL automatically creates TWO RI trigger functions per FK:
  • RI_ConstraintTrigger_a_XXXXXX  (on child: check parent exists on INSERT/UPDATE)
  • RI_ConstraintTrigger_c_XXXXXX  (on parent: check no orphans on UPDATE/DELETE)

The PARENT-SIDE triggers (RI_ConstraintTrigger_c_*) fire on EVERY UPDATE of
systems — even when updating grid_cell_id which has NOTHING to do with any FK.

This is why you saw 17 triggers in pg_trigger:
  8 FKs × 2 triggers = 16 RI triggers + 1 custom (trg_system_dirty) = 17

For EACH of 145M rows, PostgreSQL fires the parent-side RI check:
  "Does any child row reference this id64?  If so, is the NEW id64 the same?"
  (It is — we're only updating grid_cell_id, not id64 — but Postgres checks anyway
   because UPDATE fires ALL row-level triggers regardless of which columns changed,
   UNLESS the trigger uses UPDATE OF specific_column syntax.)

trg_system_dirty uses UPDATE OF (economy, population, etc.) so it correctly
skips when only grid_cell_id changes.  But RI triggers are created by
PostgreSQL internally and ALWAYS fire on any UPDATE, period.

WHY IT STALLED AT EXACTLY 41M:
  The first ~41M rows imported were from galaxy_populated.json.gz (colonised
  systems).  These have child rows in ratings, cluster_summary, watchlist, etc.
  For each of those 41M rows, the RI triggers find child rows and do extra
  index lookups.  The remaining 145M are from galaxy.json.gz (uncolonised,
  no children).  So the first 41M rows were SLOW (RI checks find rows),
  then progress appeared to stop because the cost of those checks was
  compounding with WAL pressure.  The UPDATE wasn't stuck — it was just
  running at 0.001% of its potential speed.

THE FIX: Disable triggers during bulk UPDATE
--------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL superusers can disable triggers on a table for their session:

    SET session_replication_role = replica;

This disables ALL non-ALWAYS triggers for the current session, including
RI constraint triggers.  The data is safe because:
  1. We are only updating grid_cell_id — NOT id64 (the FK column)
  2. No FK relationship involves grid_cell_id
  3. We re-enable triggers immediately after the UPDATE completes
  4. The RI constraints are still enforced for all other sessions

Alternative (if not superuser):
    ALTER TABLE systems DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;  -- requires table ownership
    ... UPDATE ...
    ALTER TABLE systems ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;

We use session_replication_role = replica as it's safer (session-scoped,
automatically reverts on disconnect) and doesn't require table ownership.

PREVIOUS BUG FIXES (v2.0 / v2.1 / v2.2, kept)
================================================
  BUG #1 — EXISTS correlated subquery (hangs 22 min) → fixed v2.0
  BUG #2 — pg_advisory_lock never released on crash → removed v2.0
  BUG #3 — pgBouncer transaction-pool breaks cursors → bypass v2.0
  BUG #4 — ALTER TABLE autovacuum AccessExclusive deadlock → removed v2.0
  BUG #5 — write_conn not rolled back on reconnect → fixed v2.0
  BUG #6 — partial Stage 2 cells accepted as complete → fixed v2.0
  BUG #7 — smallint overflow in cell_id formula → documented v2.0
  BUG #8 — stale total_systems cache causes Stage 3 skip → fixed v2.1
  BUG #9 — single UPDATE stalls at 41M (WAL/checkpoint) → fixed v2.2
  BUG #10 — RI triggers fire on every row UPDATE (the real killer) → fixed v2.3
  BUG #11 — session_replication_role set on monitoring conn, not write_conn → fixed v2.4

    Assign grid_cell_id using ctid-range (page-range) batching.

    WHY ctid BATCHING INSTEAD OF SINGLE UPDATE:
    The single-UPDATE approach stalled at 41M rows due to WAL write

    segment fills and it must fsync before continuing — this appears as
    "0 rows/min" for 5-30 minutes.

    ctid batching commits every N pages (~80 MB at default 10,000 pages).
    Each batch is a tiny transaction, WAL is flushed incrementally, and
    checkpoint pressure never builds.  Fully resumable — restart finds the
    first page with NULL grid_cell_id and continues from there.

    Why ctid instead of id64 range batching:
    id64 (Elite Dangerous system address) is extremely sparse — values span
    0 to ~20 quadrillion for 186M rows.  Batching by id64 range means each
    batch scans the entire 74GB table to find its few rows.  ctid batching

    Fallback: iterate grid cells and UPDATE systems per bounding box.

    IMPORTANT: This version avoids the two fatal bugs in v1.6:
      1. Does NOT use EXISTS subquery to pre-filter cells (too slow).
         Instead iterates ALL cells and lets WHERE grid_cell_id IS NULL
         make fully-assigned cells a near-instant no-op UPDATE (0 rows).
      2. Does NOT use a server-side (named) cursor — that breaks under
         pgBouncer transaction-pool mode.  Instead fetches all cell rows
         into Python RAM (135k rows × ~80 bytes = ~11MB — totally fine).

    With idx_sys_coords each bounding-box UPDATE is an index range scan
    (~1400 systems/cell on average = fast).  Without the index each UPDATE
    is a full seq scan of 145M rows — extremely slow.  Check first.
