# Third-Party Notices

The machine-readable per-file rights chain is maintained in
[`assets/PROVENANCE.json`](assets/PROVENANCE.json). This notice does not apply a
repository or software license to third-party media beyond the grant stated by
that media's source.

## Coalsack background images

The following bundled files are resized and/or recompressed derivatives of
ESO image `eso1539c`, **Wide-field view of part of the Coalsack Nebula**:

The source page, the JPEGs' retained EXIF description, and
[ESO's reuse terms](https://www.eso.org/public/outreach/copyright/) were
verified on 2026-08-12. ESO permits adaptation and commercial reuse under CC
BY 4.0 when the full credit remains clear, visible, and associated with the
image. The material must not be presented as an ESO endorsement. These are
real astronomical survey images and are not derived from Frontier game media.

## Web fonts

No font binary is stored in this repository. `frontend/src/index.css` requests
these families from Google Fonts at runtime. All three families are licensed
under the **SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 (OFL-1.1)**:

- **Orbitron** — Copyright 2018 The Orbitron Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron>), with Reserved Font Name:
  "Orbitron". Designer: Matt McInerney.
  [OFL text](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/orbitron/OFL.txt)
- **Manrope** — Copyright 2018 The Manrope Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/sharanda/manrope>). Designer: Mikhail Sharanda.
  [OFL text](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/manrope/OFL.txt)
- **JetBrains Mono** — Copyright 2020 The JetBrains Mono Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono>). Designer credits: JetBrains,
  Philipp Nurullin, and Konstantin Bulenkov.
  [OFL text](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/jetbrainsmono/OFL.txt)

The OFL permits use, study, modification, embedding, redistribution, and sale
with software subject to its conditions; font software may not be sold by
itself. If ED-Finder later self-hosts font files, the applicable copyright and
OFL text must travel with those copies and the Orbitron reserved-name rule must
be preserved.

## EDAssets

No EDAssets media file is currently bundled or copied into ED-Finder. EDAssets
has been inspected only as a discovery and provenance catalogue:

- Site: <https://edassets.org/#/about>
- Repository: <https://github.com/Venefilyn/EDAssets>

The EDAssets repository's MIT license applies to its licensed repository code;
it is not a blanket license for all catalogued media. EDAssets' statement that
its own project was created with Frontier permission is site-specific and is
not transferable permission for ED-Finder. Any future EDAssets-sourced file
requires its own source URL, named creator credit, media license or written
grant, Frontier-derived flag, and approval record before it is added.

## Frontier Developments fan-media boundary

Frontier's [official Elite Dangerous media guidance](https://customersupport.frontier.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/4404292442642-How-can-I-use-Elite-Dangerous-media)
covers specified fan and community uses for noncommercial purposes, requires
clear attribution to Frontier Developments plc, prohibits misleading use or
implied endorsement, and requires advance permission for promotional or
commercial use.

ED-Finder uses Frontier-derived region names and geometry only under that
noncommercial fan-media posture and displays Frontier's preferred long-form
community-site attribution. This permission does not replace the rights or
credit of any other per-file creator. Every Frontier-derived file must retain a
separate rights chain, and no such file is approved for commercial use without
a recorded written commercial grant from Frontier and every other rights
holder.

## Community-researched exploration formula

`apps/importer/src/exploration_value.py` is an original ED-Finder Python
implementation of mathematical formulae and factual game constants documented
by Elite Dangerous community researchers in the Frontier Forums thread
[Exploration value formulae](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/exploration-value-formulae.232000/).
No third-party source code is copied and the thread is not represented as
granting a source-code license. The implementation remains conservatively
within ED-Finder's Frontier noncommercial fan-project posture because it
reproduces Elite Dangerous game mechanics.

## EliteDangerousRegionMap

ED-Finder's galactic-region lookup algorithm and the region grid in
`apps/importer/src/region_map.py` and
`apps/importer/src/data/region_map.json`, together with the generated public
files `frontend/public/assets/elite-dangerous-region-map.svg` and
`frontend/public/assets/elite-dangerous-region-map.LICENSE.txt`, derive from
[`klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap`](https://github.com/klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap).
The audited upstream revision is commit
[`6c1191a`](https://github.com/klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap/tree/6c1191a58e1e593966f44f16235ab39d1ad24d84).
