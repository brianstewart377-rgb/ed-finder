"""Internal state objects for the Simulation Preview pipeline.

These dataclasses deliberately model engine state rather than public API response
shape. They keep Stage 4E as a behaviour-preserving architecture hardening pass:
calculation stages can pass typed state forward without using the eventual
response dictionary as scratch space.
