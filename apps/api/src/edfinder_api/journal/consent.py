"""V3 versioned research-consent ledger (Task 4, decision doc R7).

Explicit, revocable, versioned research-contribution consent for the
ED-Finder -> CRE evidence pipeline. Decisions are append-only per
(account, consent_version, decision) in ``v3_private.research_consent``;
effective state is the row with the greatest ``decided_at``. A WITHDRAW row
supersedes the matching GRANT row by ``decided_at``; decision history is
preserved (a GRANT and a later WITHDRAW row coexist).

Consent vocabulary (frozen)::

    CONSENT_VERSION = "1.0"
    SANITIZED_CONTRACT_VERSION = "1.0.0"
    PURPOSE = "CRE_RESEARCH_EVIDENCE"
    AUDIENCE = "CRE"

State machine: NONE -> GRANT (ok) -> duplicate GRANT (ConsentStateError,
routers map to 409) -> WITHDRAW (ok) -> re-GRANT (refused) -> duplicate
WITHDRAW (refused). Consent is never inferred from journal upload or
account creation — upload must never be conditional on consent, and this
module is deliberately not referenced from the journal import path.
