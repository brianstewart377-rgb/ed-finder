"""Stage 6C comparison — economy rules.

Owns economy-presence comparison logic. Stage 6C uses **conservative
name-keyed matching** here, by deliberate design:

* Economy evidence is matched **by economy name**.
* A predicted economy ``extraction`` is **not** contradicted just because
  an observation reports a *different* economy (e.g. ``tourism``) as
  present. That observation becomes an ``observed_only`` row for
  ``tourism`` and ``extraction`` remains ``predicted_only`` until
  evidence for ``extraction`` is recorded.
* To mark a predicted economy as contradicted, the user (or an upstream
  source) must record an observation for **that** economy with status
  ``observed_absent`` or ``contradicted``.

This is intentionally narrow. Two consequences:

* Stage 6C never overclaims that the prediction is wrong based on
  evidence for a sibling economy that is unrelated to the predicted one.
* Mutual-exclusion rules between economies live in the mechanics layer,
  not here. Stage 6C is not allowed to invent them.

Stage 6D may layer richer multi-economy heuristics on top of this
output, but the engine itself keeps the contract narrow.
