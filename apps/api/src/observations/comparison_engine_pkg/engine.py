"""Stage 6C comparison — orchestration engine.

This module owns ONLY the public orchestration entry point. All detailed
rule logic lives in the per-domain rule modules in this package:

* ``prediction_extractors`` — pull predicted services/economies/CP out
  of the prediction mapping.
* ``observation_index`` — bucket observations by fact type / subject.
* ``service_rules`` / ``economy_rules`` / ``cp_rules`` /
  ``facility_rules`` / ``build_outcome_rules`` /
  ``prediction_claim_rules`` / ``note_rules`` — per-domain comparison.
* ``summary`` — top-level summary + confidence_impact.
* ``shared`` — common helpers (evidence projection, severity clamping,
  scalar equality).

Design rules — DO NOT relax without an explicit stage decision:

1. **Pure / deterministic.** No database access, no network access,
   no global state, no time-dependent branching unless ``now`` is
   injected. The same inputs always produce the same output.
2. **No mutation.** Neither the ``prediction`` mapping nor the
   ``observed_facts`` list (or its members) is mutated.
3. **No scoring impact.** Nothing in this module is imported by
   simulation scoring, optimiser candidate generation, or optimiser
   ranking. A static passivity test enforces this.
4. **Conservative semantics.**
   * Missing observations do not contradict predictions.
   * Unknown/unverified observations do not confirm or contradict;
     they surface as ``unverified``.
   * Low-confidence observations cannot produce high-severity
     contradictions.
   * Notes never contradict — they are observed-only context.
   * Economy evidence is matched by economy name — an observation for
     a *different* economy never auto-contradicts a predicted economy.
   * One observation is evidence, not a final mechanics verdict.
