    Two modes:

    * **Mode A** — ``observed_facts`` omitted from the request. The
      router loads up to ``fact_load_limit`` persisted facts for
      ``system_id64`` via ``store.list_observed_facts_for_comparison``
      and passes them to the engine.

      Fact-loading semantics (Stage 6C hardening):
        * If ``target_archetype`` is omitted/null in the request, all
          facts for the system are loaded.
        * If ``target_archetype`` is supplied, facts are included when
          their ``target_archetype`` matches the requested value **or**
          is ``NULL`` — i.e. system-level general evidence (notes,
          service evidence, economy evidence, CP observations not tied
          to a specific target) is included alongside target-specific
          evidence. Facts targeting a *different* explicit archetype
          are excluded.
    * **Mode B** — ``observed_facts`` provided. The supplied list is
      converted to ``PersistedObservedFact`` objects and passed to the
      engine verbatim. The database is NOT queried for facts in this
      mode.

      Source semantics (Stage 6C hardening): Mode B supplied facts may
      carry any ``ObservationSource`` value including ``imported`` and
      ``inferred``. This is deliberate — Mode B is read-only and the
      supplied facts are never persisted, so Stage 6A's reserved-source
      restriction (manual/test_fixture only on create/update) does not
      apply. Persistence still goes exclusively through Stage 6A's
      ``POST /api/observations/facts`` endpoint and remains restricted.

    The handler is **passive**: it never invokes simulation, optimiser,
    or ranking code, and never mutates persisted observations. It only
    reads observations (Mode A) and runs the pure comparison engine.
