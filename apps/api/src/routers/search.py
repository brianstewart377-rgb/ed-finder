"""Search endpoints — autocomplete + local/galaxy/cluster searches.

Audit fix (2026-05-08, AUDIT_REPORT.md §C5 / Phase 2):
the previous file carried two parallel implementations of every search:
the canonical `local_search.local_db_*` builder, and a 200-line inline
fallback per endpoint that was triggered on any exception. The fallback
had drifted (e.g. it always sorted by `r.score` while the primary path
sorted by the economy-specific `display_score_col`), causing identical
requests to return different orderings depending on which path ran.

This file now has ONE search implementation per route. If the primary
path raises, we surface RFC 7807 problem-details with HTTP 503 instead of
silently degrading.

V3 (F3): `/api/local/search` (slice 1), `/api/search/galaxy` and
`/api/search/cluster` (slice 2b) read only the published V3 projections
through `local_search.local_db_search_v3` / `local_db_galaxy_search_v3` /
`local_db_cluster_search_v3`, each behind the migration-015 Finder product
gate (404 without a PUBLISHED generation, 503 until both Finder products
are READY and published) with request validation before any database
access. The legacy `cluster_summary` / `systems` / `ratings` readers are
gone from this module; a static test walks every string literal here to
keep it that way.
