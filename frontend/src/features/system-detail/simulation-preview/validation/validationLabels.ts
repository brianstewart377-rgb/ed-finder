/**
 * User-facing labels and copy for Stage 6D Validation rendering.
 *
 * Stage 6D renders the Stage 6C `/api/observations/compare` response
 * inside Colony Planner. The labels here are intentionally conservative:
 *
 *   * "contradicted" is rendered as **Needs review**, never "wrong".
 *   * "predicted_only" and "observed_only" use neutral wording that
 *     describes the asymmetry without implying the prediction is
 *     incorrect or that the observation is proof.
 *   * The advisory copy at the top makes the boundary explicit so users
 *     do not read Validation as a scoring/ranking input.
 *
 * No copy in this module classifies a prediction as proven, corrected,
 * or wrong. Stage 6D is a display layer only; mechanics/rule mutation
 * and any confidence-feedback loop are deferred to Stage 6E.
